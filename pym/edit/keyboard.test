The keyboard module
===================

    >>> from pym.edit import keyboard
    >>> assert "Provide keys based on vim's" in keyboard.__doc__
    Provide keys based on vim's

    >>> assert keyboard.vim_keys['h'] == 'left'
    >>> assert keyboard.vim_keys['j'] == 'down'
    >>> assert keyboard.vim_keys['k'] == 'up'
    >>> assert keyboard.vim_keys['l'] == 'right'

    >>> for key in keyboard.vim_keys.keys():
    ...     assert keyboard.vim_keys[key] == keyboard.keys[key]

    >>> print(', '.join([str('%s -> %s' % (k, v)) for k, v in keyboard.home_row.items()][:7]))
    a -> add, d -> delete, g -> go, f -> fix, h -> left, k -> up, j -> down
    >>> print('. '.join([str('%s -> %s' % (k, v)) for k, v in keyboard.HOME_row.items()][:7]))
    A -> insert. S -> substitute. : -> command. D -> destroy. G -> debug. F -> fuck. H -> home

    >>> class Fred(object):
    ...     def up(self):
    ...         return "Going up"

    >>> assert keyboard.move(Fred(),'k') == "Going up"
